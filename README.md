[It all starts with HTML][].

[Stimulus][] controllers [synchronize their state with the document's
HTML][stimulus-state] through [attribute][]-backed [Values][] and
[element][]-backed [Targets][].

We'll explore its potential by re-creating a portion of the [_Building Something
Real_][] section of the [Stimulus Handbook][].

Since this interaction is _only_ client-side in the browser, there's an
opportunity to do as much work as possible on the server, to the point where the
client's responsibilities are constrained, only include appending to and
removing from document

* co-locates decisions about structure, content, styles, and element references
  in the same server-generated template
* declarative, pre-populated state

The advent of the [`<template>`][template] element poses an opportunity to
server-render HTML content.

The code samples shared in this article omit the majority of the application's
setup. The initial code was generated by executing `rails new`. The rest of the
[source code][] from this article (including a [suite of tests][]) can be found
on GitHub, and is best read either [commit-by-commit][], or as a [unified
diff][].

## Our starting point

The `InvitationCodesController#show` action is our sole route. In our case, the
action serves as a simplified version of one that might generate an invitation
code on-the-fly, or read on from the database. Instead,
`InvitationCodesController#show` assigns the value of `params[:id]` into the
`@invitation_code` instance variable:

```ruby
# app/controllers/invitation_codes_controller.rb

class InvitationCodesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @invitation_code = params[:id]
  end
end
```

For example, in response to a `GET` request for
<http://localhost:3000/invitation_codes/abc123>, would result in a response with
`abc123` as the invitation code.

The `app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb` template renders two `<fieldset>`
elements: one to copy the invitation code out of, and one to paste the
invitation code into:

```erb
<%# app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb %>

<fieldset>
  <legend>Copy</legend>

  <label>
    Invitation code

    <input value="<%= @invitation_code %>" readonly>
  </label>

  <button type="button" value="<%= @invitation_code %>"
          data-controller="clipboard"
          data-action="click->clipboard#copy">
    Copy to clipboard
  </button>
</fieldset>

<fieldset>
  <legend>Paste</legend>

  <label>
    Invitation code
    <input>
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

The first `<fieldset>` pairs an `<input>` element with a `<button>` element. The
`<input>` element is pre-populated with the invitation code and marked as
[readonly][]. The `<button>` is declares its [type="button"][], and [routes
`click` events][stimulus-actions] to the `clipboard` controller:

[type="button"]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-type
[readonly]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly
[Clipboard's]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard
[stimulus-actions]: https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/actions

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/clipboard_controller.js

import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  copy({ target: { value } }) {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(value)
  }
}
```
